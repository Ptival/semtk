ISSUE:
https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/897

Our 42000 SharedUAA has this security policy problem with the full plotly 2.0.0.
We're trying just the basic module instead.

BUNDLES:
https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md#partial-bundles

https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-basic-latest-v2.js download does not succeed.
Got plotly-basic-2.0.0-rc.0.min.js instead.
